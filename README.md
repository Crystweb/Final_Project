# Final_Project

The final draft requires developers to write an application based on all the materials that they learned during the course. The result will be a flexible public web application deployed on AWS.

Goal
You need to create a site-aggregator of services or goods (for example, https: // https://www.huds.co.uk/) or https://kiev.trud.com/
or https://ua.jooble.org).
